      <h2>A Little Background</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Before we launch into hooks, I'll give a little background on why we might we might want
          hooks at all.
        </li>
        <li>
          The main impetus for hooks is class-based components vs functional components.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Functional Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Simple, JavaScript-y way to define components.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's just a function that returns a chunk of JSX.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <pre>
          <code class="lang-javascript">
            const PirateShip = props => (
              &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;h1>I'm a Pirate Ship&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;p>I have {props.masts} masts.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p>I have {props.cannons} cannons.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p>And, I have {props.crewmembers} able-bodied crewmembers.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            )
          </code>
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Class-based Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use ES2015 classes that inherit from React to create components.
        </li>
        <li>
          They allow a component to manage its own state, as well as define how it behaves at
          different points in its life.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, classes in JavaScript are a little deceptive. It's outside the scope of this talk
          to go into why, so I'll leave this
          <a href="https://github.com/petsel/not-awesome-es6-classes#tldr">link</a>
          here with an excellent explanation and list of resources that do a fantastic job of
          explaining why I would prefer to avoid ES2015 classes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code class="lang-javascript">
          class PirateShip extends React.Component {
            constructor(props) {
              super(props)
              this.state = {
                masts: 2,
                cannons: 20,
                crewmembers: 50,
              }
            }

            render() {
              return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                  &lt;h1>I'm a Pirate Ship&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p>I have {this.state.masts} masts.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p>I have {this.state.cannons} cannons.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p>And, I have {this.state.crewmembers} able-bodied crewmembers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
              )
            }
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>So... Why would I ever use Class-based Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Well, really, because React requires it.</li>
        <li>Class-based components are the only way to have local component state.</li>
        <li>Class-based components are the only to have access to the lifecycle methods.</li>
        <li>
          Functional components were relegated to use for "dumb view" components that could only use
          the data they were given.
        </li>
        <li>Until today!</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>React Hooks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>React hooks give functional components superpowers!</li>
        <li>
          Hooks make it possible to use local component state and something akin to lifecycle
          methods in a functional component!
        </li>
        <li>Here's how it works:</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <pre>
        <code class="lang-javascript">
          import React, { useState } from 'react'

          const PirateShip = () => {
            const [state, setState] = useState({masts: 2, cannons: 20, crewmembers: 50})

            return (
              &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;h1>I'm a Pirate Ship&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;p>I have {state.masts} masts.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p>I have {state.cannons} cannons.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p>And, I have {state.crewmembers} able-bodied crewmembers.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            )
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>This is the same component as the class-based version above.</li>
        <li>
          useState just takes the initial state for the component and returns the state and the
          function used to set new state.
        </li>
        <li>
          And, this is much simpler code. I don't have to remember the constructor or the separate
          render function inside the class. I don't have to deal with the weirdness that is ES6
          classes.
        </li>
        <li>This enables functions to much more viable throughout an application!</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
