      <h2>A Little Background</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Before we launch into hooks, I'll give a little background on why we might we might want
          hooks at all.
        </li>
        <li>
          The main impetus for hooks is class-based components vs functional components.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div id="slide2" class="slide">
      <h2>Functional Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use ES2015 classes that inherit from React to create components.
        </li>
        <li>
          They allow a component to manage its own state, as well as define how it behaves at
          different points in its life.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="slide3" class="slide">
      <h2>Class-based Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use ES2015 classes that inherit from React to create components.
        </li>
        <li>
          They allow a component to manage its own state, as well as define how it behaves at
          different points in its life.
        </li>
        <li>However, classes in JavaScript are a little deceptive</li>

    <div id="slide4" class="slide">
      <h2>So... Why would I ever use Class-based Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use ES2015 classes that inherit from React to create components.
        </li>
        <li>
          They allow a component to manage its own state, as well as define how it behaves at
